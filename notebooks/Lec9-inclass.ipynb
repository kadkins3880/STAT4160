Example\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","prices = pd.DataFrame({\n","    \"ticker\": [\"AAPL\", \"MSFT\"],\n","    \"date\": pd.to_datetime([\"2020-01-01\", \"2020-01-02\"]),\n","    \"adj_close\": [300, 160]\n","})\n","\n","prices.to_parquet(\"prices.parquet\", engine=\"pyarrow\", compression=\"zstd\", index=False)\n","\n","# Read back\n","df = pd.read_parquet(\"prices.parquet\", engine=\"pyarrow\")\n","print(df)\n","```\n","\n","Output:\n","\n","```\n","  ticker       date  adj_close\n","0   AAPL 2020-01-01        300\n","1   MSFT 2020-01-02        160\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Why use Parquet\n","\n","* Much smaller than CSV.\n","* Much faster to load into pandas (especially with Arrow).\n","* Preserves dtypes (like `datetime64[ns]`, `Int64`, `category`).\n","* Plays nicely with Spark, Dask, DuckDB, BigQuery, etc.\n","\n","\n","\n","```python\n","prices.to_parquet(\n","    part_dir,\n","    engine=\"pyarrow\",\n","    compression=\"zstd\",\n","    index=False,\n","    partition_cols=[\"ticker\"]\n",")\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","### 1. `partition_cols=[\"ticker\"]`\n","\n","* Instead of writing **one single Parquet file**, pandas will write a **Parquet dataset**.\n","* The dataset is split into **subdirectories by the values in `ticker`**.\n","* Each unique `ticker` value gets its own folder.\n","* Inside each folder is one (or more) Parquet files containing only rows with that ticker.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Directory structure example\n","\n","If `prices` has three tickers (`AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GOOG`), the output looks like:\n","\n","```\n","part_dir/\n","├── ticker=AAPL/\n","│   └── part-0.parquet\n","├── ticker=MSFT/\n","│   └── part-0.parquet\n","└── ticker=GOOG/\n","    └── part-0.parquet\n","```\n","\n","So the folder name encodes the partition column value: `ticker=AAPL`.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Other options\n","\n","* You can partition by **multiple columns**:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  partition_cols=[\"sector\", \"year\"]\n","  ```\n","\n","  Then the directory hierarchy will nest:\n","\n","  ```\n","  sector=Tech/year=2020/part-0.parquet\n","  ```\n","* Works only with Parquet (not CSV).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Reading it back\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = pd.read_parquet(part_dir, engine=\"pyarrow\")\n","print(df.head())\n","```\n","\n","* This automatically reassembles all partitions into one DataFrame.\n","* If you want only one ticker:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  df = pd.read_parquet(part_dir, filters=[(\"ticker\", \"=\", \"AAPL\")], engine=\"pyarrow\")\n","  ```\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"feFZZ6PuiBFv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Single-file Parquet\n","single_path = \"data/processed/prices.parquet\"\n","prices.to_parquet(single_path, engine=\"pyarrow\", compression=\"zstd\", index=False)\n","print(\"Wrote:\", single_path)\n","\n","# Partitioned dataset by ticker (directory with /ticker=.../)\n","part_dir = \"data/processed/prices_by_ticker\"\n","# pandas to_parquet supports partition_cols with pyarrow engine\n","try:\n","    prices.to_parquet(part_dir, engine=\"pyarrow\", compression=\"zstd\",\n","                      index=False, partition_cols=[\"ticker\"])\n","    print(\"Wrote partitioned dataset:\", part_dir)\n","except TypeError:\n","    # Fallback via pyarrow dataset API\n","    import pyarrow as pa, pyarrow.parquet as pq\n","    pa_tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(prices, preserve_index=False)\n","    pq.write_to_dataset(pa_tbl, root_path=part_dir, partition_cols=[\"ticker\"], compression=\"zstd\")\n","    print(\"Wrote (fallback) partitioned dataset:\", part_dir)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XxC9WsQ6hUOQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759760065133,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":462,"user":{"displayName":"David W.","userId":"14633192575819064045"}},"outputId":"7479c721-2f35-4801-d843-0f8d2bc9b22f"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Wrote: data/processed/prices.parquet\n","Wrote partitioned dataset: data/processed/prices_by_ticker\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["```python\n","import pyarrow.dataset as ds\n","dataset = ds.dataset(\"data/processed/prices_by_ticker\", format=\"parquet\", partitioning=\"hive\")\n","```\n","\n","\n","The `pyarrow.dataset` API lets you work with **datasets of Parquet (or other formats)** — not just single files.
