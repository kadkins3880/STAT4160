Implement a **date‚Äëbased splitter** that yields `(train_idx, val_idx)` for all tickers at once.\n","3.  Compute **MAE**, **sMAPE**, **MASE** (with a proper **training‚Äëwindow scale**), and aggregate **per‚Äëticker** and **across tickers** (macro vs micro/weighted).\n","4.

forecasting setup ‚Äî horizon $H$, step, rolling‚Äëorigin (expanding vs sliding), embargo\n","-    metrics ‚Äî MAE, sMAPE, MASE; aggregation across tickers (macro vs micro/weighted)\n","-    **In‚Äëclass lab**: implement a date‚Äëbased splitter ‚Üí compute naive & seasonal‚Äënaive baselines ‚Üí MAE/sMAPE/MASE per split/ticker ‚Üí save reports\n","-    Wrap‚Äëup & homework brief\n","-

this as `r_1d`).\n","\n","-   **Horizon** $H$: 1 business day.\n","\n","-   **Step (stride):** how far the **origin** moves forward each split (e.g., 63 trading days ‚âà a quarter).\n","\n","-   **Rolling‚Äëorigin schemes**\n","\n","    -   **Expanding:** train start fixed; **train grows** over time.\n","    -   **Sliding (rolling):** fixed‚Äëlength train window **slides** forward.\n","\n","-   **Embargo:** small **gap** (e.g., 5 days) between train end and validation start to avoid adjacency leakage.\n","\n","### Metrics (scalar, easy to compare)\n","\n","-   **MAE:** $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum |y - \\hat{y}|$ ‚Äî robust & interpretable.\n","\n","-   **sMAPE:** $\\frac{2}{n}\\sum \\frac{|y - \\hat{y}|}{(|y| + |\\hat{y}| + \\epsilon)}$ ‚Äî scale‚Äëfree, safe for near‚Äëzero returns with

**naive comparator** predicts $y_{t+1} \\approx y_{t+1-s}$ (we‚Äôll use $s=5$ for day‚Äëof‚Äëweek seasonality on business days).\n","    -   **Scale** is computed on the **training window only**, per
